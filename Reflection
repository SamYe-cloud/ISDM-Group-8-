Week 1 reflection 
During week 1, the group had our first zoom call meeting discussing about our assessment. Week 1 of our discussion was about task 1 of the assessment which includes an empathy map. We successfully complete all the task given to our group as our team has been in touch with the assessment a month prior and was able to work on it sooner. As usual our team has already set meetings after every tutoring sessions to ensure that our team knows their roles and any question arise. To summarise, we completed most of the task beforehand and now learning GitHub tools to ensure that our team knows how to share and submit the report.

Week 2 Reflection 
During week 2 of the session, our group came across an issue where one of our members was having internet issues. We mitigate the issues by working with the remaining team members and share the information of our session via Microsoft Teams messaging group, that way it was insured that the absent member doesnâ€™t miss up on the material. Our group also learning Forking and pull request as requested from the assessment guidelines as well as working on POV stories.
