Outline the objectives of the project and define the problem
This report provides an analysis and design of an improvement for the information system for the travel company.  The methods conducted for the redesigning of the overall call management centre system employs a number analysis tools such as design thinking methodology such as empathy maps and Brainstorming, system analysis, visual models and other non-visual methods are deployed to ensures that the Travel company has a better understanding on its improvements. The report will cover the overall problem of the system and the methods to use,  identify stakeholders to determine the projects target audience but to better understand their expectation to the project, to ensure the resulted outcome, the reasons of using scum or agile methodology as to highlight what activities that SCUM contains, the assumptions for the system analysis, the proposal of the product as well as the models used,  and the advantages gained from the new information system used. 
problem with  the new design for the Call management Centre, for a major travel company. This new information system which includes the Call Management Centre (CMC) will help the flow rate of calls to help the relation management as it is essential for the performance for the sales in holiday packages with features such as inbound  / outbound calls that would improve assistances to the relation management . These improvements if applied, it helps existing-customers or new customers and provide many features. 
The problem arises when the current RM where segmenting customers information into different segment type such as postcodes and surname, thus this report will discuss the extensive methods that will be deployed to support many more information such as the age, gender, language to create a skill matcher which finds the connections between the customers and the RM.
The solution proposed in the report would feature several benefits with the new systems, some include recruitment as RM profiles can provide many useful information such as the overall profile and skill matrix to be lodged in the system with information gathering technique such as questionnaires. This will ensure that the RMs will produce better performance in selling and serving customers more efficiency and effective than previously shown

Approach
-	Step 1 (Empathise) =  New customers and non-potential buyers will experience a different level of service from the company. Some consumers might find the company is very discriminating as they judge people from where they live. Some customers might get frustrated with the RM, due to lack of knowledge about the things they are selling when being asked. Furthermore, customers with low scores are not getting any prioritisation might make the customer not willing to buy the product anymore. Some consumers fear that they receive a different level of service. The customers might get hold for too long when the RMs are all busy. However, when this technology and idea are being implemented, the customers will have more efficiency. 
-	Step 2 (Define) = The problems are, the company should treat all their customers fairly. A highly trained and knowledgeable RM should also assist new customers or non-potential buyers. Some customers might ask another question that is more complicated to answer. Also, several customers might fail to give their complete information and a fake data. Furthermore, do not judge the customers from particular postcodes. Customers being served are not based on where they live and how high their score is, but how detail the question is being asked and how convinced they are about buying the products. Lastly, when the RMs are busy assisting others, and the customers are being redirected to the Automatic Call Distributor, make sure there is a limit of few minutes and do not make the customers wait for so long until they hang up the phone. There are lots possibilities of problem, therefore it is important to treat the customers fairly and equally. A highly knowledge RM should be use for every customer. 
-	Step 3 (Ideation) = The company could implement the use of SMS or email instead of calls for the outbound customer service. By designing a beautiful web page or website about the company that could show more wide range about what the company is selling. Using web chat could also reduce the traffic call. Some customers’ inquiries are simple and are straightforward, such as “what are the available options?” or “which package is the most recommended?” This type of questions are better with text messaging or online web chat, and it allows the customer service or RMs to help the customers with booking. Furthermore, text messaging or web chat could allow the RMs to communicate/process with the many customers simultaneously, while phone calls could only allow 1 RM to communicate, which makes it less efficient and could increase the traffic call flow and it will surely decrease the Average Handle Time (AHT). Therefore, the company could hire less people, and they can place the experienced/high knowledge score RM for every customer.  
-	Step 4 (Prototype) =  Website webchat and SMS are the best option for the customers. Because it is both beneficial for the customers and the company. The customers can get the most out of the company. Such as getting an experienced RM. Furthermore, it is also cheaper to implement webchat and SMS compared to calls, and the company does not need to hire many RMs, because 1 RM can communicate with several customers simultaneously. The customers does not need to wait for so long to get a RM to talk with them and the customers will not have to experience a high call volume. When the company are using a website, the customers could browse the website. The website will offer and give lots of knowledge to the customers. Some elderly customers might not be able to use a website, therefore, they could use SMS to reach the company. 
-   Step 5 (Test) = The company can slowly implement the use of webchat and SMS to a small amount of customer first. It is important not to test on a large amount of customer, because in case if it did not succeed, it will not impact so much on the company. The company should test on small portion on customer to receive feedbacks from the customer about the new SMS and webchat implementation. Furthermore, by testing it on the customers, the company can know that if they successfully satisfy the customers.

Week 1 reflection 
During week 1, the group had our first zoom call meeting discussing about our assessment. Week 1 of our discussion was about task 1 of the assessment which includes an empathy map. We successfully complete all the task given to our group as our team has been in touch with the assessment a month prior and was able to work on it sooner. As usual our team has already set meetings after every tutoring sessions to ensure that our team knows their roles and any question arise. To summarise, we completed most of the task beforehand and now learning GitHub tools to ensure that our team knows how to share and submit the report.

Week 2 Reflection 
During week 2 of the session, our group came across an issue where one of our members was having internet issues. We mitigate the issues by working with the remaining team members and share the information of our session via Microsoft Teams messaging group, that way it was insured that the absent member doesn’t miss up on the material. Our group also learning Forking and pull request as requested from the assessment guidelines as well as working on POV stories.

The advantage of implementing a new information system is, it increases the efficiency of the company. The information system allows the company to compete with other competitors by maintaining cheap costs, focusing on market niche, improving the performance, better response to the customers, and differentiating the products and services from the other competitors. Furthermore, information system could expand the company’s business into global markets. For instance, customers can buy tickets from all over the world. Information system can also help the company to use customer demands to improve products and services that they are selling; thus, it could improve the sales and profits of the company. 
However, a system failure could happen, when a system does not meet its requirement, or when the company is using outdated technology. Furthermore, the failure of information system in a business is due to a lack of experience to manage the new information system. When the information system fails in a business, it could lead to a huge disadvantage result for the company. Such as it could lead to substantial financial loss and bankrupt. When a business implements an information system, it requires a vast amount of money, and when it did not go as plan, the business will go bankrupt. Also, it could cause the company to lose customers. Such as, when the website is out of action and the customers could not access the website, the customers will choose another company. Therefore, it will cause permanent damage to the company’s reputation and commercial embarrassment.
